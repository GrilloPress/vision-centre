    <p>The advertised cost of laser eye surgery can be very confusing and sometimes simply misleading.  At Sheffield Vision Centre, we take a transparent and simple approach to pricing - regardless of your prescription.</p>
    <p>
    Some clinics may advertise low initial fees, but these prices often only cover very small prescriptions and the most basic of treatments.  Extra investigations and refinements in treatment will carry surcharges. At Sheffield Vision Centre we will give you an all-inclusive fee which covers the whole treatment and aftercare. Easy payment plans that spread the cost of treatment are also available.
    When making comparisons between our prices and those on the 'high street' it is important to be comparing like with like.

    <h4 class="text-center">Don’t get caught out!</h4>
    <p>There are a number of factors affecting price that most prospective laser eye surgery patients aren't aware of until they attend their consultation, such as:</p>
    <h5>Wavefront analysis</h5>
    <p>Some advertised high street prices do not include wavefront analysis or wavefront treatment. Our prices include both of these options. There is no additional cost for wavefront guided treatment, if required</p>
    <h5>All aftercare</h5>
    <p>Some clinics charge additional fees for post-operative medications, supplementary eye drops, supplementary post-operative appointments, and enhancements. Approximately one in twenty laser patients may require a second enhancement procedure to maximize the results. At Sheffield Vision Centre there is no extra charge if an enhancement procedure is required</p>
    <h5>Access to your surgeon</h5>
    <p>At Sheffield Vision Centre you will meet and be able to discuss your treatment options with your surgeon at your first visit. In many clinics, you will not meet your surgeon until the day of treatment.  Both our surgeons live locally and as such are always available for advice and follow up consultations if required</p>
    <h5>Access to your surgeon</h5>
    <p>At Sheffield Vision Centre, we charge one price for femtosecond LASIK and one for LASEK.  The reason for the disparity is simply the cost of consumables</p>
